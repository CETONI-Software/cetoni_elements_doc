<h2>Introduction to Continuous Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-continuous-flow" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In continuous flow mode you can pair two pumps together using the
software, in order to create a continuous flow over a long period of
time through alternating fluid take-up and discharge. In this case one
of the pumps doses at a particular flow rate, while the other pump takes
up reagent from the reservoir. Once the dosing pump has emptied the
syringe, the software automatically switches to the second dosing unit
with a full syringe and continues dosing with that pump. This creates a
continuous, uninterrupted flow, which lets you dose at a constant flow
rate for a nearly unlimited period of time.</p>
</section>
<section id="operating-and-display-elements">
<h2>Operating and Display Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#operating-and-display-elements" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>

<p>The continuous flow mode
is terminated automatically, as soon as you change the syringe
configuration of one of the connected dosing units. In this case you
have to reconfigure all parameters. If continuous flow has been
activated for one of the dosing units, the operating panel will indicate
“continuous flow” in its status display (see image below).</p>

<h3>Introduction to pressure-controlled switching<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-pressure-controlled-switching" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In pressure-controlled switching the pressure of the filling pump is
adapted to the pressure of the dosing pump prior to switching, through
the use of valves and pressure sensors. In addition, during the
switching process the flow of both pumps is cross-faded (cross-flow).
This prevents the occurrence of a switching impulse, while pressure and
flow rate stay nearly constant.</p>
<p>Since a certain period of time is needed to fill and cross-fade the
pump, in order to build and reduce pressure and to switch the valves,
the achievable flow rate in continuous mode is lower than the maximum
flow rate of each of the individual pumps involved.</p>
<p>In the configuration window for pressure-controlled switching you can
set all parameters and you can adjust the pressure controller of each
pump for the current configuration and the desired application pressure.</p>

<section id="tuning-parameter-overview">
<h3>Tuning Parameter Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#tuning-parameter-overview" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The continuous mode uses a dedicated pressure controller for each pump
to regulate the target pressure in the filling pump before switching to
the application. The proportional gain of the controller depends on many
factors, such as pressure, tightness, tube length and the fluid being
used. This value must be re-calibrated or retuned for each setup. The
tuning section uses the following operating elements:</p>
<img alt="../_images/1000020100000269000000BE9D9D103837FCB8A9.png" src="../_images/1000020100000269000000BE9D9D103837FCB8A9.png" />
<ol class="arabic simple guinums">
<li><p><strong>Pressure Display</strong> – depending on the dosing direction
(filling/discharge) the pressure display is colored in orange or
blue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tuning Pressure</strong> – this is where you set the pressure to which
the pressure controller will be tuned. Set the anticipated
application pressure you will use for dosing into your application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proportional Gain</strong> – this field shows you the proportional gain
of the pressure controller. If you click the button with the lamp
symbol, the system will suggest a proportional gain for the target
pressure you set. This value can be used as a starting point for
tuning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pressure Window</strong> – Defines a symmetrical range of accepted
pressure values relative to the target pressure. This means that only
if the pressure is within this window for the duration of the
<em>Pressure Window Time</em> it will be considered stable. A value that is
too high may cause the controller to overshoot, a value that is too
low may cause long times for the target pressure to settle, or may
cause the target pressure never to be reached. The value that should
be set depends on the target pressure and the quality of the pressure
sensors used. The pressure window must always be greater than the
fluctuations of the pressure sensor, otherwise the pressure will
never be considered stable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pressure Window Time</strong>– The time the pressure must be within the

<section id="tuning-the-pressure-controller">
<h3>Tuning the Pressure Controller<a class="headerlink" href="#tuning-the-pressure-controller" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A pump’s pressure controller should be tuned at the approximate piston
position at which the switching to the other pump takes place. If you
use two identical pumps, this usually happens when the syringe is almost
completely filled. To make sure that the syringe can still be filled
further for pressure building, the piston should not be in the rearmost
position. As a rule of thumb the syringe should be filled to about 90%.</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below to tune the pressure controller.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple steps">
<li><p>First, enter the desired tuning pressure <span class="guinum">❷</span>. This should be
approximately equal to the application pressure at the desired flow
rate. You can determine the tuning pressure ahead of time by dosing
into your application at the desired flow rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Now select the starting value for the proportional gain <span class="guinum">❹</span> of the
controller. If you click on the button with the lamp symbol, the
system will suggest a starting value for the selected pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>Start the tuning process by clicking the <span class="guilabel">Start Tuning</span> button. The
software will now start tuning the controller automatically. For
safety reasons tuning will begin at 50% tuning pressure, to avoid
damage due to pressure overshooting. The system tunes the controller
in such way as to arrive at the target pressure quickly with a
minimum of overshoot.</p></li>
</ol>
<img alt="../_images/100000000000029B000000D0324E5253118A97DF.png" src="../_images/100000000000029B000000D0324E5253118A97DF.png" />
<p>If achieving the target pressure takes a long time (10
seconds or more – see image below), you can interrupt the tuning process
and increase the proportional gain manually (by doubling it, for
example).</p>
<img alt="../_images/100000000000028700000096E13BE55DE415EBFA.png" src="../_images/100000000000028700000096E13BE55DE415EBFA.png" />
<p>If the controller overshoots a lot, you can interrupt the tuning process
and decrease the proportional gain manually (by halving it, for
example). Restart the tuning process with the new values.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>After a successful tuning, change the value
for the target window (Pressure Window) and start
another tuning run. You will get a feeling for how
Pressure Window value affects controller tuning.</p>
</div>
<p>During tuning the controller’s proportional gain is adjusted
automatically. If you just want to manually test the current control
parameters without the automatic adjustment, simply start a parameter
test by clicking on <span class="guilabel">Test Parameters</span>.</p>

<p>During the parameter test the pump cycles between a
non-pressurized state of 0 bar and the set tuning pressure. This lets
you visually check and evaluate the current control parameters using the
diagram.</p>
<p>Perform a right mouse-click on the diagram to open the context menu with
additional diagram functions.</p>

<h3>Setting Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-parameters" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>After tuning both pumps, go to the next page to set further parameters
for pressure controlled switching.</p>
<img alt="../_images/1000020100000322000001A5F4F82BA9F678CA6C.png" src="../_images/1000020100000322000001A5F4F82BA9F678CA6C.png" />
<p>In the <span class="guilabel">Refill Flow</span> field <span class="guinum">❶</span>, set the flow rate used to
fill the syringe. The larger you select this value, the higher the
maximum flow rate that can be realized for continuous dosing. This means
that you should always select the filling flow rate as high as possible
or as high as your application allows. If the filling flow rate is too
high, air bubbles may form.</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Timing</span> slider <span class="guinum">❷</span> lets you control the timing of continuous flow
operation. During tuning, the volume and time periods needed for
pressurizing the filling pump are determined. These time values are
multiplied by a certain factor to create a safety margin. This buffer is
used to compensate for delays during pressure building, which can be
caused by issues or variations in the system. You can use the slider to
select a higher margin (<em>Robust Timing</em>) or a lower margin (<em>Tight
Timing</em>).</p>
<p><img alt="image03_19" src="../_images/10000000000001C70000004CD2D8CDFE5C22501F.png" /></p>
<p>Using a larger buffer decreases the flow rates that can be
achieved in comparison to a smaller buffer. In the same way, a smaller
buffer increases the risk of disrupting the continuous flow timing in
case of system issues or variations, possibly leading to flow
instabilities. Double-clicking on the slider sets the standard value we
recommend, unless you absolutely need a higher or lower flow rate.</p>
<div class="note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>A small safety buffer for the timing
increases the risk that the timing of the continuous
flow is disturbed and the continuous flow is
interrupted if the application pressure fluctuates or
if other disturbances occur.</p>
</div>
<p>In the field <span class="guilabel">Maximum feasible flow (ml/s)</span> <span class="guinum">❸</span> you can see the maximum
flow rate that can be achieved with the set parameters. The coloured bar
shows how far away this flow rate is from the maximum flow rate that you
can achieve in normal pump operation mode. This allows you to quickly
see how the refill flow rate and timing affect the realizable flow rate.</p>
<p>Once you have set all parameters, continue the configuration with

<h2>Configuring Cross-Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-cross-flow" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>

<p>In the <span class="guilabel">Refill Flow</span> field <span class="guinum">❶</span>, set the flow rate used to
fill the syringe. By pressing the <span class="guilabel">Min</span> and <span class="guilabel">Max</span>
buttons. The larger
you select this value, the higher the maximum flow rate that can be
realized for continuous dosing. This means that you should always select
the filling flow rate as high as possible or as high as your application
allows. If the filling flow rate is too high, air bubbles may form. This
flow rate is always slightly higher than the rate indicated in the
<span class="guilabel">Maximum feasible flow (ml/s)</span> field <span class="guinum">❹</span>, since the syringes must be
filled more quickly in order to be ready for the next dosing run when
the syringes are switched.</p>
<p>Cross-flow makes it possible to cross-fade the flows of the dosing
modules. This is done by configuring the <span class="guilabel">Cross-flow Duration</span>
<span class="guinum">❷</span>.</p>
<p>In the field <span class="guilabel">Maximum feasible flow (ml/s)</span> <span class="guinum">❹</span> you can
see the maximum
flow rate that can be achieved with the set parameters. The coloured bar
shows how far away this flow rate is from the maximum flow rate that you
can achieve in normal pump operation mode. This allows you to quickly
see how the refill flow rate and timing affect the realizable flow
rate.</p>
<p>The following image shows the cross-fading of flows from two individual
pumps.</p>
<img alt="../_images/100002010000034B000002BF708D26F0E1102F63.png" src="../_images/100002010000034B000002BF708D26F0E1102F63.png" />
<p>The Cross-Flow-Duration t<sub>cross</sub> expresses the period of time needed for cross-fading one
dosing module to the other. The smaller this value, the steeper the flow
rate curve and the less time is required for the cross-flow operation to
be completed.</p>
<img alt="../_images/1000020100000320000002A28DB2B4CFC4D85EB4.png" src="../_images/1000020100000320000002A28DB2B4CFC4D85EB4.png" />
<p>Cross-flow offers you a simple way of
compensating for pressure drops during switching. The <em>Overlap Time</em> t<sub>ov</sub>
<span class="guinum">❸</span> governs the period of time by which the flow curves of both
dosing modules overlap. The larger the tov value, the longer both dosing
modules keep dosing simultaneously (see image above).</p>

<h2>Set flow rate and duration of continuous flow<a class="headerlink" href="#set-flow-rate-and-duration-of-continuous-flow" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In this window (figure below) you set the flow rate at which the
continuous flow is started <span class="guinum">❶</span> and the duration of dosing <span class="guinum">❷</span>. If you don’t
want to limit the duration, simply leave the setting at <em>Dose
unlimited</em>. With this setting continuous flow is maintained until you
stop the dosing process manually.</p>

<p>The software offers you three ways of limiting the duration of
continuous flow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Dose volume</strong> – continuous flow is stopped as soon as a defined
dosing volume has been reached.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dose for –</strong> continuous flow ends after a predetermined duration of
time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dose until</strong> – continuous flow ends at a specific time in the future.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="starting-stopping-continuous-flow">
<h2>Starting/Stopping Continuous Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-stopping-continuous-flow" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>After the configuration you can start continuous flow
operation by a left mouse-click on the <span class="guilabel">Start Dosing</span> button in the direct
controller window.</p>
<p><img alt="image03_23" src="../_images/10000201000000DC0000004C9FC9EE927968E354.png" /></p>
<p>You can interrupt continuous flow operation at any time by

<p><img alt="image03_24" src="../_images/10000201000000DC0000004C5F506061A78F169E.png" /></p>
<p>If you stop a dosing unit involved in continuous flow operation, you
also stop the other dosing unit tied into the system. If you have
configured a particular duration for continuous flow operation, stopping
a dosing unit will also interrupt the preset duration, meaning that when
you restart the dosing unit, continuous flow operation will resume for
the time remaining at the point of interruption. If you configured a
target volume for continuous flow operation, the system will resume
dosing the remaining volume at the time of interruption, upon restart.</p>
</section>
<section id="cancel-restart-continuous-flow">
<h2>Cancel/Restart Continuous Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#cancel-restart-continuous-flow" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Once the preset time for continuous flow operation has elapsed or the
target volume has been reached, continuous flow operation is terminated
and both dosing units are stopped. Performing a left click on the
<span class="guilabel">Start</span> <span class="guinum">❶</span> button lets you restart continuous flow operation. In this
case the duration or target volume will be reset to their starting
values. Left clicking on the <span class="guilabel">Continuous Flow</span> <span class="guinum">❷</span> button terminates
continuous flow mode and stops the continuous flow operation in
progress. In this case re-starting will not be possible (see image
below).</p>

<section id="change-flow-rate-in-continuous-flow">
<h2>Change flow rate in continuous flow<a class="headerlink" href="#change-flow-rate-in-continuous-flow" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You can change the flow rate during a dosing run in all operating modes.
To achieve this enter the desired flow rate into the <span class="guilabel">Flow</span> field <span class="guinum">❶</span>
and confirm by clicking on <span class="guilabel">Start</span> <span class="guinum">❷</span> with the left mouse button (see image

<p>The dosing module accepts the
change in flow rate, while retaining all other dosing parameters, such
as volume or continuous flow parameters. When you configure continuous
flow operation you will be shown the maximum dosing flow rate achievable
with the currently set refill rate and the other continuous flow
parameters, for guidance (see image below).</p>
