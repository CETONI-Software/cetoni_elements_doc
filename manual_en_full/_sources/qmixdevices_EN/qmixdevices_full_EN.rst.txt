Optional Add-On Plugins
-----------------------

There are optional extensions of the software, which CETONI has
developed, possibly on your behalf, according to customer
specifications. However, certain plugins may not be required for a
certain device configuration, or may not be suitable for this purpose.
When creating and editing a device configuration, you can freely
configure which optional plugins should be loaded with your device
configuration.

.. tip::
   The CETONI Elements software can be extended
   with customer-specific plugins. Please contact us if
   you need a specific adaptation of the software
   functionality.

If you only have a standard version of CETONI Elements installed, no
optional add-on plugins will be available. Accordingly, the function for
configuring optional add-on plugins is disabled (see figure below).

If you have installed a CETONI Elements add-on that contains optional plugins,
this function is available (see figure below).

.. admonition:: Important
   :class: note

   Not every CETONI Elements add-on
   contains optional plugins. Many add-ons (e.g.
   Spectroscopy Add-On) contain only mandatory plugins
   that must be loaded to provide device functionality.
   Mandatory plugins cannot be selected using this
   function. These are always loaded automatically if the
   respective device (e.g. Qmix λ) has been configured.

If you click with the left mouse button on the :guilabel:`Add-On Plugins`
function, the Add-On Plugins Selection Dialog appears. In the lower half
of the dialog, there is a table that displays all available optional
add-on plugins (see figure below).

You can display information about the Add-On plugin by moving the mouse
over the respective table entry (see figure below).

To add an optional add-on plugin to your device configuration, check the
box next to the plugin :guinum:`❶` and then click :guilabel:`Ok` :guinum:`❷`.
Finally, you must save the configuration :guinum:`❸` to permanently apply the
changes (see figure below).
